# PDFQuery-using-Langchain

## Overview
This project showcases the utilization of LangChain, a natural language processing toolkit, for querying information from PDF documents. It allows users to extract text from PDF files, split them into manageable chunks, and perform question-answering tasks using a language model. While this example employs budget PDFs for demonstration purposes, the techniques presented here can be applied to any PDF containing textual information.
